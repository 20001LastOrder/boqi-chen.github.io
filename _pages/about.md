> I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ece)](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/) at McGill University, supervised by [Prof. Daniel Varro](https://liu.se/en/employee/danva91) and [Prof. Gunter Mussbacher](https://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~gmussb1/). Additionally, I work as an R&D engineer at [Aggregate Intellect](https://www.ai.science/) through a Mitacs grant. My research focuses on applying model-based techniques to enhance the reliability and robustness of machine learning systems. I am also actively involved in projects evaluating the quality and properties of machine learning models for various software engineering tasks, such as model generation, bug detection, and code summarization. With the rapid advancements in large language models, I am exploring their potential in software engineering applications and to further improve their robustness and reliability.

> Currently, I'm a part-time research associate at _Huawei Waterloo Research Center_. Besides I'm also an active contributor to the open-source project [Sherpa](https://github.com/Aggregate-Intellect/sherpa) that aims to build a robust and easy-to-use large language model framework.

I also organize a bi-weekly (sometimes weekly) _discussion group on graph neural networks_ and their applications. You can find the scedules [here](https://www.notion.so/boqi-chen/GNN-Discussion-Group-9c763d37f6dd4a73b0befb0f67d10493). If you are interested in joining, please subscribe to this [calendar](https://lu.ma/gnn-discussion-group). We are also actively looking for new speakers, so if you are interested in presenting your work or any topics you are interested in, please feel free to reach out to me.
